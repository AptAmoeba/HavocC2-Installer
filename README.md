# HavocC2-Installer
Auto-installs Havoc C2 &amp; patches existing issues present in the framework (Apt Package ver.). Originally made for my students to save class time; opened for anyone to use.

&nbsp;

## Why Use This Script?
The default Apt Package version of Havoc C2 comes with some bugs that are irritating to fix. 
This script serves as a fire-and-forget approach to installation & patching, and it prints usage instructions at the end for:
- Provisioning Operators in the havoc.yaotl file.
- Starting the TeamServer
- Starting the Client

Originally, this was only written for my students in order to save time during class. But, since it's useful, I opened it up for anyone to use.

Until they patch the Apt Package of Havoc to ship without issues, this script should save you time!

## Usage
Pull the .sh file and do the following:
- #~$ sudo chmod +x ./HavocHelper.sh
- #~$ sudo ./HavocHelper.sh

&nbsp;

## Supported (Tested on) Operating Systems
- Kali Linux
