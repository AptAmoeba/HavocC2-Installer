# HavocC2-Installer 
Auto-installs Havoc C2's Dev branch (the most up-to-date Havoc version) &amp; handles building, and adds some small Quality-of-Life adjustments. Originally made for my students to save class time; opened for anyone to use.

&nbsp;

## Why Use This Script?
This script serves as a fire-and-forget approach to:
- Dev Branch installation
- Automatic Building
- Adding the Havoc binary to PATH for easier invocation (no more "./havoc")

&nbsp; 

It also prints usage instructions at the end of the installer for easy copy/paste:
- Provisioning Operators in the havoc.yaotl file.
- Starting the TeamServer
- Starting the Client

&nbsp;

## Usage
Pull the .sh file and do the following:
- #~$ sudo chmod +x ./HavocHelper.sh
- #~$ ./HavocHelper.sh

&nbsp;

## Supported (Tested on) Operating Systems
- Kali Linux
